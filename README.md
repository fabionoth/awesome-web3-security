# Awesome Web3 Security

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

It is a collection of awesome software, libraries, documents, books, resources, and cool stuff about **web3** security.

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/fabionoth/awesome-web3-security/graphs/contributors). You're awesome. This wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized, community-driven collection of very well-known resources.
